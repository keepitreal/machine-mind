Cryptocurrency trading strategies

I decided to make this public as these strategies don't work in the current market. The triangular arbitrage strategy in particular
really only performed well in the boom of late 2017, early 2018 because of market inefficiencies in lower volume exchanges. 

The only "completed" stragegy is triangular arbitrage. I was mostly just testing out the others. And by "completed" I mean they generate a 
a trio of profitable orders for each successful tri-arb pair, but couldn't place the order.
